<b><p class="description" style="color:red">INTRO OF SIAMESE</p></b><br>
<br>Siamese cats came from Thailand, then known as Siam. There’s still a debate about how old they exactly are, but the Thai manuscript “Tamra Maew” (“The Cat Book Poems”) seems to depict them. The work was created between the 14th and 18th centuries. They were also described as being held in high esteem by royal families. It was believed that after death the soul of a family member enters the body of a Siamese.
