<b><p class="description" style="color:red">INTRO OF AMERICAN SHORTHAIR</p></b><br>
<br>American shorthairs are a medium- to large-sized cat breed with a thick, dense coat that has a tendency to thicken during the winter months but only requires minimal grooming. American shorthair colors include white, blue, black, cream, red, silver, golden, cameo (a white base with red tips), and chinchilla (white root with dark tips). Patterns can be calico, solid, bicolor, tabby, smoke, tortoiseshell, and shaded. Despite this extensive selection, brown tabby and silver tabby are the most common—and treasured—color patterns.
