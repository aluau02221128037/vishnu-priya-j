<b><p class="description" style="color:red">INTRO OF PERSIAN</p></b><br>
<br>As one of the oldest cat breeds, Persian cats can be traced all the way back to the 1600s. While there are question marks about where they came from, they’re believed to have originated in Mesopotamia, later called Persia (hence the name), which is now modern day Iran. It’s said that they were smuggled out of Persia by European explorers in the 17th century.
